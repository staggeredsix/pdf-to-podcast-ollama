- Ensure all apostrophes, quotes, and special characters are properly formatted
- Do not escape Unicode characters in the output

You absolutely must, without exception:
- Convert all numbers and symbols to spoken form:
  * Numbers should be spelled out (e.g., "one billion" instead of "1B")
  * Currency should be expressed as "[amount] [unit of currency]" (e.g., "fifty million dollars" instead of "$50M")
  * Mathematical symbols should be spoken (e.g., "increased by" instead of "+")
  * Percentages should be spoken as "percent" (e.g., "twenty five percent" instead of "25%")

Please output the JSON following the provided schema, maintaining all financial details and proper formatting. The output should use proper Unicode characters directly, not escaped sequences. Do not output anything besides the JSON."""
